# assertX_16-by-16-Sudoku-Solver
In this project, you are going to use recursion to solve a variant of Sudoku puzzles.  Rather than the standard 9-by-9 version, your program will solve 16-by-16 (hexadecimal) Sudoku.

# The Input File
•The input file is a plain text file (filename: puzzle.txt).

•There is only one Sudoku puzzle stored in the input file.  However, the puzzle may have more than one solution.

•The input file contains 16 lines of 16 characters each.  A dot ('.') is used to indicate a blank cell.  Therefore, the sample puzzle would be stored in the input file


# The Output File
•The output file is a plain text file (filename: solutions.txt).

•Your program will write all the solutions of the puzzle in the input file to the output file.

•Each solution should be presented the same as in the input file with all the blanks appropriately filled.

•Each solution needs to be numbered (e.g., "Solution 1", "Solution 2", and so on).
